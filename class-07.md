# [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)
- creating a conceptual model to represent a specific problem and establishes the limits of the problem domain
- can verify and validate the understanding of the problem
- modeling single entities of many instances: build objects
  - model the attributes with a constructor function to define the properties
  - model the behaviors with smaller, more focused methods
  - create instances using the `new` keyword and call a constructor function
  - store `new`created objects in a variable to access properties and methods (outside)
  - use `this` variable within methods to access properties and methods (inside)

## Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)
- `new` keyword and obect custronctors create blank objects
  = can add properties and methods to these objects
  - empty an object using `var object = {}`
- update values using dot notation ( object.property = value )
  - can also update properties (but not methods) using square bracket syntax ( object['property'] = 'value')
  - object constructors can use a function as a *template* to create objects.
