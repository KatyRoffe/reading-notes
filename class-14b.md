# [What Google Learned About Teams](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

- Rozovsky wanted to find a job that was more social
- Accepted to Yale
- Study groups have become a rite of passage party to see who can navigate group dynamics
- BUT there were lots of conflicts over who was in charge of the group
- People would try to show authority by speaking over each other 
- Rozovsky fely like she couldn't make any mistakes around her group
<br>

- Marshall Van Alstyne is/was a progessor at Boston Univerisity, and he studies how people share information
- There's have been a lot of peopel decoting themselves to studying everything about team composition to figure out how to make employees faster, better, and more productive both in a team and out of one
- While the data is easy to discern about an individual, it is not  as easy when it comes to the group as a whole
- Does not matter how the data has been arranged, it has been almost impossible to find patterns or evidence that how a team was made makes any difference to the end results of productivity

- The google experiment: 699 people divided into small groups and given a series of assignments that reqired different kinds of cooperation. 
  - not all the "good teams" appeared to behave in the same ways
  - some teams had smart cookies who broke up the work evenly
      - "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking" :: members spoke roughly in the same proportion
  - some teams were full of average joes who found a way to take advantage of everyone's strengths
- all teams followed the same trend though: in the teams where everyone got a chance to talk and participate, they did well. all teams where only one or two people took the lead and dominated the conversation, collective intelligence declined. 
- the "good" teams all had average social sensitivity
- the more successful teams in the experiment all had people who were above average at social sensitivity. they could tell how individuals in the group were feeling.
- In other words: 
    - Team A: focused, intelligent, optimized for peak individual efficiency, but discourages equal speaking, no "interpersonal data" being exchanged
    - Team B: "turn taking," may appear disorganized, socialize and go on tangents, but team members speak when they feel the need, and the group is all around more aware of the group AND individuals' moods
<br>

- Psychological Safety :: The sense of confidence that the team will not embarass, reject, or punish any member who speaks up
- some teams are made up of people who require so much emotional energy that they become draining due to fights over leadership, the tendency to critique, 
- some teams leave you with energy because they allow everyone to feel relaxed and there is an ehtusiasm for other people's ideas
- While making sure teams have clear goals and are creating a culture of dependability, psychological safety plays a critical role in making a team work effectively
- Sometimes people are likable outside of a group, but getting together on a team brings out a different side of them that makes the group's culture go wrong
- conversational turn-taking and empathy are part of the rules that we turn to and are good for helping to establish a sense of psychological safety

- no one wants to put on a "work face"
- no one wants to leave part of their personality or inner life at home
- people want to feel free enough to share things about themselves without the fear of recriminations
- people want to feel free to talkabout things that are messy or sad or have hard conversations with 'difficult' coworkers
- putting things like empathy and sensitivity into reporting makes them easier to talk about
-
