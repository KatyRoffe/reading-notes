READ: 01 - LEARNING MARKDOWN

# Reading Notes

Markdown is, in a sense, the most basic way in which to style text on web pages and applications. 
I am somewhat familiar with it due to using it semi-regularly on the Discord chatting app...

...though I usually have to refererence a [handy bookmark](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) in order to remember the proper formatting.

My favorite examples of Markdown syntax are the ones used for emphasis purposes. 

Example | How to format
------------ | ------------ 
**Bold** | ``**bold**``
*Italics* | ``*italics*``
~~Strikethrough~~ | ``~~strikethrough~~``









You can even add images! For example, here is a headshot of my cat, Peggy.
