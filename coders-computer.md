# Text Editors: Software used for writing and managing text, especially regarding websites. 

## Beneficial Features
### Code Completion
Code completion displays possible suggestions of coding based on the original data the user was beginning to enter. This saves both time and reduces the risk of typos. It is similar to the autofill function in text messaging or the predictive text of forumulas in Excel. 

### Syntax Highlighting
Syntax Highlighting changes the colors of the text to differentiate between elements within the code. It makes the text easier to read. It also makes it easier to identify errors. 

### Theme Variety
Themes allow changes in the coloring of text and backgrounds of the text editor. It is important to use a theme that reduces eye strain and fatigue. 

### Extension Selection
Extensions are like software plugins. They allow for additional features to be added to the text editor. As the user grows in their text writing needs, adding extensions for increased functionality is a must.
