# `useState()` Hook

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
  
- React is a framework for user interfaces that allows JS & HTML to sort of combine into JSX to be displayable in the front-end

2. What is the primary difference between a functional component and a class component?

- functional component: plain JS function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element
- class component: extends a class and requires a render function to return a React element

## Vocab

- **Functional Components:** simply a JS function, not a class
- **Children / Child Components:** a component that inherits properties of its parent component
