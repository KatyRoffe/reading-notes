# AWS: S3 and Lambda

1. Describe “The Cloud”

    - software and services that run on the internet instead of on a local machine

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

    - packages of software that have all the necessary elements to run in any environment

3. What is auto-scaling?

    - an automated approach to increasing/decreasing the compute/memory/networking resources that are allocated

4. What is bandwidth?
    
    - a measure of how much info a network can transfer

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?

    - it's a type of "pay as you use" system with the costs calculated by hardware and upkeep charges

## Vocab

- **Server Instances**: a collection of SQL SErver databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service/instance
- **Containers**: packages of software that have all the necessary elements to run in any environment
- **Cloud Services**: IT services that are provisioned and accessed from a cloud computing provider
- **Cloud Architecture**:the overall cloud computing servies and solutions that are implemented within the boundaries of a business's network
- **AWS**: amazon web services / serverless cloud hosting
- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**: [source](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)
    - they have comparable features and pricing
    - heroku's pricing takes quite a price jump as features increase
    - but AWS has a fairly linear pricing model
    - heroku is generally easier to use
