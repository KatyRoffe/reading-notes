## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Simple Steps (spend most of the time working through steps 1-3)
    1. Read the problem through completely. **At least twice.**
        - make sure you can explain the problem to someone else
        - the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it
    2. Solve the problem manually with sample data. **Use three sample sets.**
        - by first solving a problem manually, you know what you will be automating later
        - write down every single step no matter how small
        - for example, to reverse a string, writing down each character in that string would be a separate step
    3. Optimize the manual steps.
        - if there are steps that can be combined into a single action, figure out how to do that here
    4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
        - this outlines the structure of the code based on optimized steps 
    5. Replace these comments/pseudo-code with real code.
        - figure out the syntax that would best execute the comments/pseudo-code
    4. Optimize the real code.
        - make sure variables are named meaningfully, get rid of duplications, etc
        - basic refactoring
