# Access Control

## 1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

- basic auth is used when transmisitting userid/password pairs as credentials encoded using base64
- basic auth scheme is not secure, so HTTPS should be used in conjunction
- bearer auth uses secure tokens (bearer tokens/cryptic strings) generated by the server to fulfil a login request
- bearer auth should also only be used over HTTPS

## 2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

- allows for implementing JWTs, which securely transmit details via a JSON object
- it is verifiable because it is digitally signed

## 3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

- don't store them in the app but in an env file

## Vocab

- **encryption:** the process of encoding data
- **token:** pieces of data that represent a user and permissions during an auth process
- **bearer:** a type of auth using token authentication made up of cryptic strings
- **secret:** types of credentials that should not be kept within the app to avoid unauthorized access
- **JSON Web Token:** compact digitally signed JSON object of authentication
