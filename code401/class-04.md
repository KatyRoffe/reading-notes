# Data Modeling

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  
* the design becomes modular || it focuses on a single feature until the test has passed
* it documents the code better || tests can illustrate how the code is supposed to work, which can save time from creating detailed documentation
* less debugging || as codebases become larger, they become harder to maintain. implementing testing from the start helps make sure the code works and will need less debugging in the future

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

* these are used to help implement work that needs to be done repeatedly and for many tests

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

* unit testing can be taken to the extreme. frequently refactoring the tests means you're spending too much time working on the test suite.

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

* class defines a type that can be instantiated at runtine
* prototype is an object instance

## Why REST?

* REST APIs are incredibly flexible
* Based on standard HTTP operations and uses non-ambiguous terminology

### Vocab

* **functional programming:**  emphasizes the use of functions and each function performs a specific task [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-functional-programming-and-object-oriented-programming/)
* **object-oriented programming (OOP):**  based on object orientation. importance is given to data rather than procedures. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-functional-programming-and-object-oriented-programming/)
* **class:**  templates for creating objects
* `super`: keyword. used to access and call function on a parent object
* `this`:  keyword. used to refer to what the object it belongs to
* **Test Driven Development (TDD):**  the process of developing software by drafting tests by which to code against to ensure the program runs as expected
* **Jest:**  a JavaScript framework designed to help implement testing
* **Continuous Integration (CI):**  automating the integration of code changes by multiple devs into a single software projct [source](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)
* **REST:**  representational state transfer. an architectural style in the development of web services
* **Data Model:**  abstract model that organizes data elements, standardizing how they relate to each other and the real-world
