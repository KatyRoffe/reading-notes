# React Native

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

- ducks is a proposal for bundling reducers, action types, and actions all in the same file
- it seeks to resolve the issue of the repetitive nature of organiing by type
- the toolkit itself is an opinionated toolkit for using Redux

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- the official toolkit from Redux, using it makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development

## Vocab

- **redux toolkit slices:** functions that accept an initial state, an object of reducer functions, and a name. they generate action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state
- **namespace:** allows for unique names (in certain areas) while using redux
