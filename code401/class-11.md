# Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?

- ensures a user's actions are limited to assigned permission

2. Describe an application that would need access control.

- any application with multiple levels of user authorities. social media sites, forums, etc.

3. What is a role used for?

- defining a set of persmissions which can be assigned to a user. 

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

- permissions are scaled based on established roles rather than specific individuals. doing it the latter way would become difficult to manage

## Vocab

- **Authorization:** determining if an individual is granted specific permissions
- **Role Based Access Control:** users being granted permissions based on assigned roles
- **Capabilities:** actions that the roles are allowed to perform
