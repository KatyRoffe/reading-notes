# AWS Cloud Servers

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle.

- client makes a request
- server processes the request
- server returns the response to the client

2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC.

- the server is the man behind the curtain, listening for requests, compiling the appropriate data, and returning it as a response

3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

- hosting it on an appropriate site that will work all the installations and configurations so that the public can access the app instead of it being merely hosted on a local device

## Vocab

- **Server**: hardware/software to provide functionality for clients (devices)
- **Pub/Sub**: publisher/subscriber | a messaging pattern that allows services to communicate asynchronously
- **WRRC**: web request response cycle | how a request is processed through an app
