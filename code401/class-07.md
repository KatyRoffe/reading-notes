Make a request to the access token endpoint
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

## 1. What can you do with an authorization code?

* they are used for entry or transactions where the user has restriction on what is accessible

## 2. What can you do with an access token?

* allows access to information from APIs

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

* it is considered more secure due to the OAuth tokens expiring and requiring reauthentication

## Vocab

* **Client ID:** a unique public identifier of a client application
* **Client Secret:** a "secret" known only to  an application and the authorization server
* **Authentication Endpoint:** security designed to ensure only authorized devices can connect to a given network/server/site
* **Access Token Endpoint:** where apps make a request to get an access token for the user
* **API Endpoint:** the point where an API and software connect
