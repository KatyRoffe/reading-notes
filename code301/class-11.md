- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - Tables

- What is a ‘schema’?
  - strict requirements or the data being stored
  - in a table, the schema is defined by 'fields'

- What is a NoSQL database?
  - databases tthat store and retrieve data without defining its structure

- How does it work?
  - uses collections and documents instead of tables - they don't require the same schema

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  - collections and documents with a variety of formatting

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  - MongoDB because it doesnot require a strict schema. data can be added over time without the use of relying on previous structure formats

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - data being pulled may not fit the format of the data a user is currently working with
