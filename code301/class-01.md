# [Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

## What is a component?

- a software object designed to interact with other componenets
- modular, portable, replacable, and reusable sets of functionality

## What are the charactistics of a component?

- Reusability: designed to be reused in different situations in different applications
- Replacability: substituted with similar components
- Not context specific: designed to operate in different environments
- Extensible: extended to provide new behaviors
- Encapsulated: depicts an interface but does not expose internal processes
- Independent: have minimal dependencies on other components

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

- Ease of deployment: able to update to newer versions
- Reduced cost: third-party componenets help spread dev and maint costs
- Ease of development: well-known interfaces provide pre-defined functionality
- Reusable: usable in multiple systems (which also reduces costs)
- Modification of technical complexity: component containers modify complexity 
- Reliability: reliability of componenets increases reliability of overall system
- System maintenance and evolution: easy to update without affecting the overall system
- Independent: flexible connectivity
