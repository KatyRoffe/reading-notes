* What is functional programming?

  - a way of building the elements of computer programs that avoids changing state and mutable data

* What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  - pure functions return the same results if given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects

* What are the benefits of a pure function?

  - they are predictable and easy to test

  - the data's state cannot be changed after it's created

  - the combo of having a pure function and immutable data
