# [How I Explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

- a computer scientist who helped to develop the first web servers and the documentation to explain how and why the web works

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- the techniques weren't designed the way Fielding and his colleagues intended. most techniques devs use get machines to talk to a small number of other machines as opposed to any machine in the world. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- it's essentially about applying verbs to nouns when it comes to the machine

4. What does a `GET` do?

- it gets information that is requested

5. What does a `POST` do?

- it adds something to a system

6. What does `PUT` do?

- it replaces something in a system

7. What does `PATCH` do?

- partially udpates another system

## Things I want to know more about

- might do more research on Fielding
