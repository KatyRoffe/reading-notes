## Control Flow
The *control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. 

It runs through the lines in order, first tolast, unless there is a structure in place to change the control flow. 

These structures could be conditionals, loops, or function. 

A typical script in Javascript will include many of these control structures or include portions set to execute when specific events occur. 


## Functions
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. 

They are defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a **name** and a set of parentheses **()**
> Function names have the same rules as variable names. They can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. 
> Function **parameters** are listed inside the parentheses
> Code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets **{}**
> The values received by the function when it is invoked are known as **arguments.**

The are executed when circumstances call it to action. This is called **invocation.** Invocation includes:
* when an event occurs (such as a user clicking a button)
* when it is invoked from JavaScript code
* *Automatically (self-invoked)

When a `return` statement is reached, the function will stop executing. 
> If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after invoking the statement. 
> Functions often compute return values.

### Why use functions? 
Functions allow the user to define the code one  and reuse it many times with different arguments to obtain different results.
