# Wireframing
It is a practice used to define and plan a hierarchy of the information going into a project. 
On a website, it is the visual design of the layout and a way to gauge how a user is meant to interact with the pages through use of buttons, diagrams, dropdown menus, etc.
It lets you plan out the design without the distraction of color. 
It can be approached in different ways. Some prefer to draw out their wireframe by hand while others prefer the use of online tools or aps. 

## Wireframe tools
* Pen and paper
* UXPin
* InVision
* Wireframe.cc

## Six Steps
1. Research your audience
2. Prepare research for easy referencing
3. Map out the user flow
4. Draft the design
5. Add details and test
6. Create prototypes

## Principles
* The wireframe should be clear and ensure the users most important questions are answered
* The ease of access should increase the user's confidence in the brand
*  Simplicity is better than having too much information bombarding the user

# HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Is it the building blocks of content on webpages. 

HTML is a series of elements that affect the formatting of the content. 

Elements consist of four (4) main parts. Consider the following example.

Name | Example | Description
----- | ----- | ----- |
Opening Tag | `<p>` | this is where the element begins
Closing Tag | `</p>` | this is where the element ends
Content | "This is a paragraph" | content between the opening and closing tags
Element | `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` | this is the completed element from start to finish 

HTML can be used in a markdown file, but markdown cannot be used in an HTML file.
