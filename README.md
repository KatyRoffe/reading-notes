## What is *Growth Mindset?*
Growth Mindset is not only the decision to become a better version of youself, but also the actions taken to follow through. It is the realization and acknowledgement that natural ability, whether it be talent or intelligence, are merely stepping stones in the grand scheme of personal growth. It takes patience, effort, detemination, and a sense of humor as we advance in our pursuits. 

### To keep myself in my own growth mindset:
* I will not compare myself to others. We all grow at different rates appropriate for our own well-being. 
* I will remind myself that mistakes are not failures. Getting up again is what will make me grow. 
* I will not give up. I may not understand the material now, I just need to find a new way to relate to it.
