# About JavaScript

JavaScript is a language that powers the dynamic behavior of websites. If a page is doing more than displaying static information, Javascript is likely the reason why.

JavaScript is *not* the same as Java. 

## Variables

Variables are containers for data that is stored in the computer's memory. They are referenced by *unique* names called **identifiers**.  These identifiers can be simple or descriptive. 

The general rules for constructing an identifier are:
* they may contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
* they must begin with a letter ($ and _ are treated as letters)
* they are case sensitive (y is not the same as Y)
* Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used. 

Creating a variable is called **declaring** a variable. 

There are three (3) ways to declare a JavaScript Variable.
* var :: used in previous version of JavaScript
* let :: used to declare a variable that can be reassigned
* const :: used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned (a constant)

## Data Types

JavaScript can hold numbers and text. Text, in programming, is known as *strings*. 

Type | Example
----- | -----
Number | 12345
String w/ numerals | "67890"
String w/ text | "hello world!"

> String is identifiable as being contained within quotation marks. Numerals contained within quotation marks are strings, not numbers.
